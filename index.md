# Welcome to my game site!

## A little about me
#### Hello, I am Bera Koklu, and I have just started coding. After a few weeks, I realized that I had found my passion. I started learning Lua, but in only a few days, I thought it would be easier to start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, I have created 2 games, both open source!

## My games

#### This is my first game. Even though the name suggests that there are coins in the game, there isn't. You guess a number 0-100, and if you get it right, you do. It started out with alerts and prompts, but I finally upgraded to HTML forms. It took me about 8 hours to get it fully functional. After moving on to HTML forms, my original functions stopped working. After I tried to fix it, it broke completely. So, I had to use Alex P. Castro's handy functions. I altered the code a little bit, and then it worked. But it is quite sad that it is deprecated now.

#### This is my second game. This game is a little more complex than the first one. You click on the computer chip and you can sell them. As you progress through the game, you earn more types of computer parts! This game is currently being updated constantly and bugs happen frequently. This would be my first big project.
