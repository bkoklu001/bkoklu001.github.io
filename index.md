## A little about me
Hello, I am Bera Koklu, and I have just started coding. After a few weeks, I realized that I had found my passion. I started learning Lua, but in only a few days, I thought it would be easier to start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, I have created 2 games, both open source!

#### This is my first game. Even though the name suggests that there are coins in the game, there isn't. It started out with alerts and prompts, but I finally upgraded to HTML forms. It took me about 8 hours to get it fully functional. After moving on to HTML forms, my original functions stopped working. After I tried to fix it, it broke completely. So, I had to use Alex P. Castro's handy functions. I altered the code a little bit, and then it worked.
