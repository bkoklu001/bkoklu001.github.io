# A little about me
Hello, I am Bera Koklu, and I have just started coding. After a few weeks, I realized that I had found my passion. I started learning Lua, but in only a few days, I thought it would be easier to start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, I have created 2 games, both open source!
